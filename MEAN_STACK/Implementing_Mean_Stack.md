# MEAN STACK

The MEAN stack is a popular technology stack used for building dynamic web applications. It's an acronym that stands for MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS (or Angular), and Node.js. Each component of the stack serves a specific purpose:

1. **MongoDB**: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It's known for its scalability and flexibility, making it suitable for handling large volumes of structured or unstructured data.

2. **Express.js**: Express.js is a minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features for building web and mobile applications, including routing, middleware support, and template engines.

3. **Angular (or AngularJS)**: Angular is a front-end JavaScript framework maintained by Google. It's used for building dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) with a modular and structured approach. In the context of the MEAN stack, AngularJS or Angular is responsible for handling the client-side logic and user interface.

4. **Node.js**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server-side, enabling the development of scalable and high-performance web applications. In the MEAN stack, Node.js serves as the server-side runtime environment for running Express.js and handling server-side logic.

Together, these technologies form a full-stack solution for developing modern web applications, where MongoDB handles data storage, Express.js manages server-side logic and routing, Angular (or AngularJS) handles client-side interactions and user interfaces, and Node.js provides the runtime environment for running JavaScript code on the server. This stack is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and ability to handle real-time applications efficiently.
