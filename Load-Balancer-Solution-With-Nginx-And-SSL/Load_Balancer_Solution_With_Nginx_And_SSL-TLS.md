# Load Balancer Solution With Nginx and SSL/TLS

As a versatile DevOps engineer, it's essential to understand different load balancing solutions. In this project, we focus on configuring an Nginx Load Balancer solution. Additionally, ensuring secure connections to web applications via HTTPS is crucial to protect data in transit.

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Load Balancing**:
   - Distributes traffic across multiple servers for improved performance and reliability.

2. **Nginx**:
   - A high-performance web server that can also function as a load balancer.

3. **HTTPS**:
   - Encrypts data between clients (browsers) and web servers to prevent Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks.
   - Protects sensitive information like bank details and social media credentials.

#### Importance of SSL/TLS:
- **Security Technology**: Protects data from MITM attacks by encrypting the session between the browser and the web server.
- **Terminology**: SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its newer version, TLS (Transport Layer Security), are referred to as SSL/TLS. Though SSL has been replaced by TLS, the term SSL is still widely used.

By implementing an Nginx Load Balancer with SSL/TLS, you ensure secure, efficient, and reliable web traffic management.

## Task

This project consist of two parts:

- Configure Nginx as a Load Balancer
- Register a new domain name and configure secure connection
