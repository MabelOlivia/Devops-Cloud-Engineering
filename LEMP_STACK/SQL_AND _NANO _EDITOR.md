SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. 

Summary:

SQL provides a set of commands for querying, updating, and managing relational databases. It allows users to interact with databases to perform tasks such as retrieving data, inserting records, updating existing data, and deleting records. SQL is widely used across industries for handling data-related tasks efficiently and securely.

SQL syntax consists of a set of rules and conventions for writing SQL statements to interact with databases. Here's a brief overview of the SQL syntax:

1\. \*\*Keywords\*\*: SQL statements are composed of keywords like SELECT, INSERT INTO, UPDATE, DELETE FROM, CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE, etc. These keywords indicate the type of operation to be performed.

2\. \*\*Clauses\*\*: SQL statements typically consist of various clauses, each serving a specific purpose. Common clauses include:

`   `- \*\*SELECT\*\*: Specifies the columns to be retrieved from a table.

`   `- \*\*FROM\*\*: Specifies the table from which to retrieve data.

`   `- \*\*WHERE\*\*: Filters rows based on specified conditions.

`   `- \*\*GROUP BY\*\*: Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.

`   `- \*\*HAVING\*\*: Filters groups based on specified conditions.

`   `- \*\*ORDER BY\*\*: Sorts the result set based on specified columns.

`   `- \*\*LIMIT/OFFSET\*\*: Limits the number of rows returned by a query.

`   `- \*\*INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN\*\*: Specifies how tables should be joined together.

Here's an example of a simple SQL SELECT statement:

\```sql

SELECT column1, column2

FROM table\_name

WHERE condition;

\```

This statement selects specific columns (`column1`, `column2`) from a table (`table\_name`) based on a condition specified in the `WHERE` clause.

Here's an overview of some commonly used SQL commands and their syntax

1\. \*\*SELECT\*\*: Retrieves data from the "employees" table.

`   ````sql

`   `SELECT employee\_id, first\_name, last\_name FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR';

`   ````

2\. \*\*INSERT INTO\*\*: Adds a new record to the "customers" table.

`   ````sql

`   `INSERT INTO customers (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');

`   ````

3\. \*\*UPDATE\*\*: Modifies existing records in the "products" table.

`   ````sql

`   `UPDATE products SET price = 20.99 WHERE category = 'Electronics';

`   ````

4\. \*\*DELETE\*\*: Removes records from the "orders" table.

`   ````sql

`   `DELETE FROM orders WHERE status = 'Cancelled';

`   ````

5\. \*\*CREATE TABLE\*\*: Creates a new table named "students".

`   ````sql

`   `CREATE TABLE students (

`       `student\_id INT PRIMARY KEY,

`       `first\_name VARCHAR(50),

`       `last\_name VARCHAR(50),

`       `age INT

`   `);

`   ````

6\. \*\*ALTER TABLE\*\*: Adds a new column named "address" to the "customers" table.

`   ````sql

`   `ALTER TABLE customers ADD address VARCHAR(100);

`   ````

7\. \*\*DROP TABLE\*\*: Deletes the "temp\_data" table.

`   ````sql

`   `DROP TABLE temp\_data;

`   ````

8\. \*\*CREATE INDEX\*\*: Creates an index on the "username" column of the "users" table.

`   ````sql

`   `CREATE INDEX idx\_username ON users (username);

`   ````

9\. \*\*DROP INDEX\*\*: Deletes the index named "idx\_email" from the "customers" table.

`   ````sql

`   `DROP INDEX idx\_email;

`   ````

10\. \*\*JOIN\*\*: Combines data from the "orders" and "customers" tables.

`    ````sql

`    `SELECT orders.order\_id, customers.name 

`    `FROM orders INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer\_id = customers.customer\_id;

`    ````

11\. \*\*GROUP BY\*\*: Groups orders by their status from the "orders" table.

`    ````sql

`    `SELECT status, COUNT(\*) 

`    `FROM orders 

`    `GROUP BY status;

`    ````

12\. \*\*HAVING\*\*: Filters orders with more than 5 items from the "orders" table.

`    ````sql

`    `SELECT customer\_id, COUNT(\*) as order\_count 

`    `FROM orders 

`    `GROUP BY customer\_id 

`    `HAVING COUNT(\*) > 5;

`    ````
