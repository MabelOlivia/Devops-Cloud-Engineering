### Self-Study Notes:

**1. Database Management Systems (DBMS)**:
- **Relational DBMS (RDBMS)**:
  - Organizes data into tables with rows and columns, adhering to a predefined schema.
  - Utilizes SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and manipulating data.
  - Ensures data integrity through ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.
  - Suitable for applications requiring complex queries, transactions, and relational data modeling.
  - Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.
- **NoSQL DBMS**:
  - Encompasses various types like document-based, key-value pairs, column-oriented, and graph databases.
  - Designed for handling unstructured or semi-structured data, scalability, and high-performance requirements.
  - Offers flexibility in data modeling and schema design.
  - Common types include:
    - **Document Stores**: MongoDB, Couchbase.
    - **Key-Value Stores**: Redis, DynamoDB.
    - **Column Stores**: Cassandra, HBase.
    - **Graph Databases**: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune.

**2. Web Application Frameworks**:
- **Server-side Frameworks**:
  - Handle backend logic, including routing, database interactions, authentication, and business logic.
  - Provide tools and libraries to streamline development and ensure security and scalability.
  - Examples:
    - Django (Python): Batteries-included framework emphasizing rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
    - Ruby on Rails (Ruby): Convention over configuration framework promoting developer productivity and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
    - Express.js (JavaScript): Minimalistic, flexible framework for building web applications and APIs using Node.js.
- **Client-side Frameworks**:
  - Enhance user experience by handling frontend logic, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and UI updates.
  - Leverage JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web interfaces.
  - Examples:
    - React.js: Component-based library for building reusable UI components, maintained by Facebook.
    - Angular: Full-fledged MVC framework maintained by Google, offering features like two-way data binding and dependency injection.
    - Vue.js: Progressive JavaScript framework for building modern web applications with a focus on simplicity and flexibility.

**3. JavaScript Syntax**:

Introduction
<br>
JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language primarily employed for adding interactivity to web pages. It's a client-side scripting language, meaning it runs in the user's browser rather than on a server. Understanding the basic syntax of JavaScript is fundamental for writing efficient and functional code.


- Variables: Declare and assign values using var, let, or const.
- Data Types: Include primitive types (e.g., string, number, boolean, null, undefined) and objects (e.g., array, function, object).
- Operators: Perform operations like arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and bitwise operations.
- Control Structures: Use if, else, else if, switch, for, while, do-while for flow control.
- Functions: Define reusable blocks of code using function keyword, supporting parameters and return values.
- Objects: Create and manipulate objects using literal notation or constructor functions, accessing properties and methods.


1. Comments:
   Comments are used to annotate code for clarity and documentation. JavaScript supports two types of comments:

   ```javascript
   // This is a single-line comment

   /*
   This is a multi-line
   comment
   */
   ```

2. Variables:
   Variables are containers for storing data values. In JavaScript, you declare variables using the var, let, or const keywords.

   ```javascript
   var a = 5;
   let b = 'Hello';
   const c = true;
   ```

3. Data Types:
   JavaScript supports various data types:

   ```javascript
   let num = 10;
   let str = "JavaScript";
   let bool = true;
   let arr = [1, 2, 3];
   let obj = { name: "John", age: 30 };
   let func = function() {
       console.log("Hello!");
   };
   ```

4. Operators:
   JavaScript includes various operators for performing operations on variables and values.

   ```javascript
   let x = 10;
   let y = 5;
   let z = x + y; // Addition
   let result = (x > y) ? "x is greater than y" : "x is less than or equal to y"; // Ternary Operator
   ```

5. Control Structures:
   JavaScript provides control structures to control the flow of the program.

   ```javascript
   let num = 10;
   if (num > 0) {
       console.log("Positive number");
   } else if (num < 0) {
       console.log("Negative number");
   } else {
       console.log("Zero");
   }

   let i = 0;
   while (i < 5) {
       console.log(i);
       i++;
   }
   ```

6. Functions:
   Functions are blocks of reusable code. JavaScript functions can be defined using the function keyword.

   ```javascript
   // Function Declaration
   function greet(name) {
       return "Hello, " + name + "!";
   }

   // Function Expression
   let greet = function(name) {
       return "Hello, " + name + "!";
   };

   console.log(greet("John"));
   ```

Conclusion
<br>
This covers the basic syntax of JavaScript, providing a foundation for writing JavaScript code. Understanding these concepts is essential for developing dynamic and interactive web applications. 

**4. RESTful API (Representational State Transfer)**:
- **Design Principles**:
  - Statelessness: Each request from a client must contain all the information necessary to process the request.
  - Uniform Interface: Standardized resources and methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for interaction.
  - Resource-Based: Resources (e.g., entities like users, products) are uniquely identifiable via URIs.
  - Client-Server Architecture: Separation of concerns between client and server, enabling scalability and flexibility.
- **Usage in Web Development**:
  - Building scalable and maintainable web services and APIs.
  - Enabling interoperability between different systems and platforms.
  - Promoting separation of concerns and loose coupling in distributed systems.
- **Implementation**:
  - Define endpoints and HTTP methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.
  - Use HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests.
  - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for secure access to resources.
  - Document APIs using standards like OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) for better understanding and usage.

**5. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)**:
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) Documentation

Introduction
<br>

CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It defines how HTML elements should be displayed on a web page, including layout, colors, fonts, and more. Understanding CSS is crucial for creating visually appealing and user-friendly web interfaces.

1. Selectors and Declarations:
   CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and declarations to define their styles.

   ```css
   /* Selector followed by declaration */
   h1 {
       color: blue;
       font-size: 24px;
   }

   /* Multiple selectors can be separated by commas */
   h2, h3 {
       color: green;
   }
   ```

2. Properties and Values:
   CSS properties define various aspects of element styling, while values specify the settings for those properties.

   ```css
   /* Property followed by value */
   color: red;
   font-size: 16px;
   background-color: #f0f0f0;
   ```

3. Units of Measurement:
   CSS supports different units for specifying lengths, such as pixels (px), percentages (%), em, rem, and more.

   ```css
   width: 200px;
   margin-top: 20%;
   padding: 1em;
   ```

4. CSS Selectors:
   CSS selectors allow you to target specific HTML elements to apply styles.

   - **Element Selector**: Targets HTML elements by their name.
   - **Class Selector**: Targets elements with a specific class attribute.
   - **ID Selector**: Targets elements with a specific ID attribute.
   - **Descendant Selector**: Targets elements that are descendants of a specified element.
   - **Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements**: Allows styling based on element state or position.
   
   ```css
   /* Element Selector */
   p {
       color: red;
   }

   /* Class Selector */
   .highlight {
       background-color: yellow;
   }

   /* ID Selector */
   #header {
       font-size: 20px;
   }

   /* Descendant Selector */
   div p {
       font-style: italic;
   }

   /* Pseudo-class */
   a:hover {
       text-decoration: underline;
   }

   /* Pseudo-element */
   p::first-line {
       font-weight: bold;
   }
   ```

Conclusion
<br>
CSS is a powerful tool for styling web pages, allowing developers to control the appearance and layout of HTML elements. By understanding CSS selectors, properties, and units of measurement, you can create visually appealing and responsive web designs. Continued practice and experimentation will enhance your proficiency in CSS styling.
